## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Dogs, echo=FALSE}
dogs <- read.csv("~/Downloads/dogs.txt", sep="")
is.data.frame(dogs)
```
PART A :
```{r , echo=FALSE}
# FOR NORMALITY CHECK
qqnorm(dogs[,1], main="QQ plot for Isofluorane"); qqline(dogs[,1])
```
QQ plot deivaties at the tail. It doesn't seem to follow a normal distribution.
```{r}
shapiro.test(dogs[,1])
```
p-value of shapiro-test is less than 0.05 therefore the claim that it follows a normal distribution is rejected.

```{r}
qqnorm(dogs[,2], main="QQ plot for halothane"); qqline(dogs[,2])

```
Looking at the QQ-plot it is reasonable to say that Halothane data is from a normal distribution.
```{r}
shapiro.test(dogs[,2])
```
shapiro test p-value is greater than 0.05. It follows a normal distribution.

```{r}
qqnorm(dogs[,3],main = "QQ plot for cyclopropane"); qqline(dogs[,3])
```
Very less diviation therefore, we can say that it comes from a normal distribution.

```{r}
shapiro.test(dogs[,3])
```
shapiro test p-value is greater than 0.05. It follows a normal distribution.

PART B : 

CORRELATION TEST : 
```{r correlation, echo=FALSE}
## correlation isofluorane and halothane
cor.test(dogs[['isofluorane']],dogs[['halothane']],method="spearman")

```
p value of 0.5 is greater than 0.05 therefore, we can't reject the null hypothesis that there is no linear correlation. Hence, isofluorane and halothane are not linearly correlated.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
qqnorm(dogs[,1]-dogs[,2] , main = "QQ plot for (Isofluorane - Halothane)")
qqline(dogs[,1]-dogs[,2])
```
QQ plot - Very less diviation therefore, we can say that it comes from a normal distribution.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
shapiro.test(dogs[,1]-dogs[,2])
```
shapiro test p-value is 0.8744 which is greater than 0.05. Therefore, the difference in isofluorane and halothane is normally distributed.

Two paired sample T-Test : 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
t.test(dogs[,1],dogs[,2],paired=TRUE)
```
p value of 0.7145 is more than 0.05, therefore there is no difference between the effect of isofluorane and halothane. Distribution of these columns are not significantly different.

PERMUTATION TEST:
 
```{r permuttaion test}
boxplot(dogs[,1],dogs[,2],names=c("isoflurane","halothane"))

```
```{r}
mystat=function(x,y) {mean(x-y)}
B=1000; tstar=numeric(B)
for (i in 1:B) {
  dogstar=t(apply(cbind(dogs[,1],dogs[,2]),1,sample))
  tstar[i]=mystat(dogstar[,1],dogstar[,2]) }

myt=mystat(dogs[,1],dogs[,2])
#myt
hist(tstar)

```
```{r}
pl=sum(tstar<myt)/B
pr=sum(tstar>myt)/B
p=2*min(pl,pr)
p
```
p value of 0.63 is more than 0.05, therefore there is no difference between the effect of isofluorane and halothane. Distribution of these columns are not significantly different

Permutation test for two-paired samples is valid here and it doesn't depend on the distribution of data. Here, T-test will perform better than the permutation test because data of difference in isofluorane and halothane is normally distributed. 

PART C : 
One - way ANOVA: 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
dogsframe=data.frame(yield=as.vector(as.matrix(dogs)),variety=factor(rep(1:3,each=10)))

is.factor(dogsframe$variety); is.numeric(dogsframe$variety)

dogsanova=lm(yield~variety,data=dogsframe)
anova(dogsanova)
```
The p-value  0.011, hence HA : μ1 = μ2 = μ3 is is rejected with 95% significance level. Therefore, the type of drug has an effect on the concentration of plasma epinephrine.

```{r}
qqnorm(residuals(dogsanova),main = "QQ plot of estimated erros") 
```
QQ plot of residuals eik = Yik − μi (k = 1 to 10 and i = 1 to 3 ) looks close to a normal distribution.
```{r}
plot(fitted(dogsanova),residuals(dogsanova))
```
The plot of fitted(group means) against residuals show no pattern.

Therefore, assumptions for one-way ANOVA hold true.

Estimated concentrations of epinephrine for different drugs:
```{r, echo=FALSE}

#isoflurane
mean(dogs[,1])
#halothane
mean(dogs[,2])
#cyclopropane
mean(dogs[,3])

```
Estimated average concentrations of epinephrine for isoflurane, halothane and cyclopropane are 0.434,0.469 and 0.853 respectively.



Krushal-Wallis Test:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
kruskal.test(yield~variety,data=dogsframe)
```

p-value for krushal-wallis test comes out to be 0.05948. Therefore, HA:  μ1 = μ2 = μ3 can't be rejected. The type of drug has no effect on the concentration of plasma epinephrine.


Conclusion - The reliability of ANOVA test depends on the assumption that the data comes from a normal dsitribution. Whereas, Krushal-Wallis Test is a non-paramteric test and doesn't depedent on the distribution of data.
For the above data ANOVA test and Krushal-Wallis Test arrive at different conclusions. ANOVA test accepts that the type of drug has an effect on the  concentration of plasma epinephrine whereas Krushal-Wallis test rejects this claim.
The above data follows a normal distribution therefore, the result of one-way ANOVA is more reliable than Krushal-Wallis Test.
